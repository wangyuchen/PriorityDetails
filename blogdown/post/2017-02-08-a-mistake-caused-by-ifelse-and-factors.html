<p>I made a mistake in one of the data processing script I wrote in R a while ago and figured I should share the story with everybody.</p>
<p>The mistake was caught recently when I had to re-do a similar request again. I’ve already discarded the script, so I started from scratch, and found that part of the numbers didn’t match the old ones in one of the tables I sent. Without the old scripts, it’s quite hard to figure out what happened, and it turned out it’s just one letter that caused the problem.</p>
<p>Here’s a simplified example. There are two variables in this survey data set, and they work together as a time measurement. One is called something like <code>ABC_DEFG123HIJ_UN</code> that stands for unit of time, and the other is called <code>ABC_DEFG123HIJ_NN</code> which stands for the actual number. Here’s a snippet of how the data looks like. In reality I can’t view or print out the data because it’s too big.</p>
<pre><code>##    CASEID ABC_DEFG123HIJ_UN ABC_DEFG123HIJ_NN
## 1      31     (2) 2 = Hours                 2
## 2      21   (1) 1 = Minutes                 5
## 3      70     (2) 2 = Hours                 1
## 4      22     (2) 2 = Hours                NA
## 5      47   (1) 1 = Minutes                30
## 6      61     (2) 2 = Hours                 2
## 7      25   (1) 1 = Minutes                 5
## 8      43     (2) 2 = Hours                 3
## 9      54   (1) 1 = Minutes                NA
## 10     10     (2) 2 = Hours                 1</code></pre>
<p>To convert everything into time and calculate average (and also base size), this is all I needed to do.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dplyr)
sample_data %&gt;% 
  mutate(time = ifelse(ABC_DEFG123HIJ_UN == &quot;(1) 1 = Minutes&quot;, 
                       ABC_DEFG123HIJ_NN, ABC_DEFG123HIJ_NN * 60)) %&gt;% 
  summarise(avg_time = mean(time, na.rm = TRUE), 
            n = sum(!is.na(time)))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1 × 2
##   avg_time     n
##      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;
## 1     72.5     8</code></pre>
<p>However, this is not what I’ve reported! I had an average of <span class="math inline">\(60.4\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> non-missing observations. You probably have noticed that <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> non-missing value is an error already, but without actually seeing the data I wouldn’t know. The average of <span class="math inline">\(72.5\)</span> is close but since <code>n</code> is also different, I started to suspect that I might’ve used a wrong variable. Since I’m sure I’m using the same data, logically it can only be from a different variable that has <span class="math inline">\(9\)</span> non-missing values, right?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After going through all 2000 variables, I can’t find any other variable that has exactly <code>9</code> non-missing values and produces an average of <span class="math inline">\(60.4\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After struggling for 2 days, I found that the following script gave me the exact same result as before. Note that I misspelled <code>_NN</code> as <code>_UN</code>, probably because of auto-completion.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sample_data %&gt;% 
  mutate(time = ifelse(ABC_DEFG123HIJ_UN == &quot;(1) 1 = Minutes&quot;, 
                       ABC_DEFG123HIJ_UN,  # A typo here
                       ABC_DEFG123HIJ_NN * 60)) %&gt;% 
    summarise(avg_time = mean(time, na.rm = TRUE), 
              n = sum(!is.na(time)))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1 × 2
##   avg_time     n
##      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;
## 1 60.44444     9</code></pre>
<p>A closer look at what happened. I accidentally put a factor and a numeric into one <code>ifelse</code> call, it converts them all to integer silently, and returned the integer levels of the factor. Not only did it change the values silently, it coincidentally converted the missing value too.</p>
<p>Consider a simpler example.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(123)
factor(LETTERS[1:5])</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] A B C D E
## Levels: A B C D E</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># returns numeric vector instead of letters and numbers as character
ifelse(rnorm(5) &gt; 0, factor(LETTERS[1:5]), 6:10)  </code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 6 7 3 4 5</code></pre>
<p>Note that the <code>3, 4, 5</code> was from the factor of letters. You usually see it like characters when it was printed, but it’s actually integers with labels. For more details of factors, see <a href="http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Data-structures.html#attributes">this paragraph</a> from <em>Advanced R</em>.</p>
<p>Comparing to this one, where one factor and one character are in an <code>ifelse</code> call, the factor will be converted to character, but not to their labels, but to the integer values.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ifelse(rnorm(5) &gt; 0, factor(LETTERS[1:5]), LETTERS[6:10])</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;I&quot; &quot;J&quot;</code></pre>
<p>In my data, the missing values associated with level <code>&quot;(2) 2 = Hours&quot;</code> will not be affected, because it’s in the <code>FALSE</code> statement of the <code>ifelse</code>. However, the missing values in “(1) 1 = Minutes”, because of the misspelling, were converted to integer <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, along with other values, in the <code>TRUE</code> statement. Look at all the <code>time</code> values that comes from a <code>&quot;(1) 1 = Minutes&quot;</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sample_data %&gt;% 
  mutate(time = ifelse(ABC_DEFG123HIJ_UN == &quot;(1) 1 = Minutes&quot;, 
                       ABC_DEFG123HIJ_UN,  # A typo here
                       ABC_DEFG123HIJ_NN * 60))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 10 × 4
##    CASEID ABC_DEFG123HIJ_UN ABC_DEFG123HIJ_NN  time
##     &lt;int&gt;            &lt;fctr&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1      31     (2) 2 = Hours                 2   120
## 2      21   (1) 1 = Minutes                 5     1
## 3      70     (2) 2 = Hours                 1    60
## 4      22     (2) 2 = Hours                NA    NA
## 5      47   (1) 1 = Minutes                30     1
## 6      61     (2) 2 = Hours                 2   120
## 7      25   (1) 1 = Minutes                 5     1
## 8      43     (2) 2 = Hours                 3   180
## 9      54   (1) 1 = Minutes                NA     1
## 10     10     (2) 2 = Hours                 1    60</code></pre>
<p>The typo created a valid new column from part-factor and part-integer, without any warning or error message, and perfectly disguised with some missing values carried over from “Hours”, and that caused me to look for variables that has 9 non-missing values and overlooked the real problem.</p>
<p>This is really annoying – even a funciton as simple as <code>ifelse</code> is not that straightforward and safe to use. The mistake would be more obvious if I wasn’t using two variable names that close, but the unexpected behavior dealing with two variables from different classes still shouldn’t be ignored.</p>
<p>Then Hadley came to rescue. Use <code>dplyr::if_else</code> instead of <code>ifelse</code> to improve error and missing value handling.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Give warnings when converting integer to factors
if_else(rnorm(5) &gt; 0, factor(LETTERS[1:5]), 6:10)  </code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning in `[&lt;-.factor`(`*tmp*`, i, value = 10L): invalid factor level, NA
## generated</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] A    B    C    D    &lt;NA&gt;
## Levels: A B C D E</code></pre>
<pre><code># Don&#39;t convert factors
if_else(rnorm(5) &gt; 0, factor(LETTERS[1:5]), LETTERS[6:10])
## Error: `false` has type &#39;character&#39; not &#39;integer&#39;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Handling missing in condition
if_else(c(TRUE, FALSE, NA), 1, 0, missing = -1)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1]  1  0 -1</code></pre>
<p>Therefore I recommend using <code>dplyr::if_else</code> whenever possible and use caution when dealing with factors. There might be some new package coming out soon to handle factors appropriately.</p>
