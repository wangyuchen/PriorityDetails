# About the Author
I've used R for statistical analysis and developed over 20 R packages over the years. In school, I had worked as a research assistant for 3 years, started off doing applied statistics projects, and worked on several computational problems in the last year. Now I'm working as an analyst for a marketing research company.


# About Priority Details
As you know, R is a language whose packages are mainly written by statisticians. Being a statistician myself, I hate how terrible we are at programming... Although there are so many packages out there, there aren't many good ones. Inconsistent APIs, lack of documentation, and unstable R code usually make figuring out a new package a huge pain. I've been through such pain a lot, so hopefully you don't have to.

This blog will be covering the details I spent time figuring out. Not all the details, but only the ones you need to know to make it work. For example, today I spent some time on how to run an mixed effect ordered logit and how to run multiple comparison with `lsmeans`, and also on different ways to use standard evaluation in `dplyr`. I'll also blog some of my own projects and the idea behind them.
